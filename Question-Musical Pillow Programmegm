In a family party, people are playing the musical pillow game in which people sit in a circle. Starting from the first person, they transfer the pillow to the person to their left. For simplicity, we'll assume that people are assigned an integer tag from 1 to n (which is the total number of people) in the clockwise manner, so that during the game pillow is passed in the increasing sequence of. When the game starts, a song is played and the person with the pillow at the end of the song is eliminated and the game starts again till there is only one person left, which is declared as the winner of the game.
